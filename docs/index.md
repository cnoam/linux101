**TODO:**
```
- should we have for each chapter a format [ objectives, contents, summary] ?
```

This short course should take you 8..12 hours of watching short videos, reading and mainly trying things on your computer.

It is planned for students who uses Windows (or Mac) and have never used linux, especially never used the command line.

At the end of this course, you will be able to connect to a linux computer, and run basic commands on it. Most important: The FEAR will be gone!
